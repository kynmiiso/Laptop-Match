"""Output display

Idea:
-   Have a list (1-5) closest laptops to dummy laptop
-   Include links to google searches where users can learn more about the laptop
-   Include button to show more laptops.
    Alternatively, making it "multi-page" where user can go to next page for more laptops

More suggestions???
-   Can include pictures using URL? kinda optional imo
-   Show specs or similarities

TODO:
-   Create the pygame screen
-   Create a ListItem class
-   Decide whether we do it vertical or horizontal list (up-down or left-right)
-   Back to form button
